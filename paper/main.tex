\begin{abstract}
Traffic encryption has become commonplace in communication over the internet, due to the threats which lurk there for unprotected "surfers". 
Though aiding security, traffic encryption renders the analytical applications that rely on clear text, and provide the means to optimize video delivery, useless. 
One such group of applications is the ones that try to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users who consume video content. 
% Video traffic consistently, and at a high pace, becoming one of the main content categories propagated over the internet, so it is not surprising that video content providers (VCP) put much emphasis on the development of automated tools that will be able to predict QoE of the end users. 
As the demand for Video Conferencing (VC) solutions surging over the past few years,
% \cite{chang2021can} \cite{feldmann2020lockdown}
it's becoming more than ever relevant to provide a reliable QoE assessment tool also for this domain.
% and specifically for the Zoom VC application, as it was widely adapted by many schools and organizations worldwide \cite{choi2022zoom} \cite{espin2021impact} \cite{nistico2020comparative}.
Many models for QoE prediction have been proposed over the years, but most of them had two main drawbacks, viz. they dealt only with the problem of streaming video and operated mainly in an unencrypted setting, i.e., where the original image is available and can serve as a reference.
In this paper, we propose a new model for prediction of the QoE which can assess it in video conferencing applications. We developed a custom Deep Neural Network architecture, which can predict resolution, frames per second (FPS), and Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) criteria with an accuracy of 90.489\%, 92.492\%, and 97.643\% respectively, only from features which may be easily extracted from an encrypted traffic. The code for the network may be found at \url{https://github.com/mchlsdrv/qoe}.


% As we move forward with the development of the internet technologies, more and more threats to the end user using it arrive. Thus, it is not surprising that today the traffic encryption has become one of the basic requirements of any application using the internet. Though aiding user's security, encrypting the traffic may render the course of execution of other services difficult or even impossible. One class of  the ones which analyze the quality of experience (QoE) that the user gets from a video conferencing service (e.g., Zoom), and try to adjust various network parameters to increase it. As the demand for video conferencing services grow constantly and with a high pace, there is a great importance in being able to improve the QoE of users, and in the light of the aforementioned problem, it must be done even if all we have at our disposal is an encrypted traffic. Many efforts were applied to solve this challenge in the field of the video on demand (VoD) services. Surprisingly enough though, the venue of video conferencing (VC) has been left overlooked, which makes us, to the best of our knowledge, the first to try to address this issue here. In this paper, we study the network behaviour of an encrypted Zoom traffic, and apply several machine learning (ML) algorithms, including decision trees (DT) and neural networks (NN), to gain insight into the QoE of the end users. We find that by applying our methods, we can predict the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) criterion and the frames per second (FPS) parameter, with an accuracy of 97\%, and 87\% accordingly. In addition we obtained a 76\% accuracy on the spatial frame resolution (SFR) prediction task, which stands on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for VoD traffic prediction.
% Encryption of Internet traffic is on the rise, with transport encryption becoming a mandatory for Internet applications. While enhancing security, encryption of traffic may impede the operation of ancillary services reliant upon it. For instance, services tasked with assessing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of video conferencing platforms users, such as Zoom, may encounter difficulties in adjusting network parameters to optimize QoE. Given the persistent and rapid growth in demand for video conferencing services, there is a need to enhance user QoE, necessitating solutions that cope with encrypted traffic. While considerable efforts have been invested to address similar challenges in video on demand (VoD) services, the domain of video conferencing (VC) has been comparatively neglected, making this research, to the best of our knowledge, pioneering. In this study, we examine the network behavior of encrypted Zoom traffic and employ various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including decision trees (DT) and neural networks (NN), to gain insights into end-user QoE. We use packet measurement metrics to predict the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) criterion and frames per second (FPS) parameter with accuracies of 97\% and 87\%, respectively. Furthermore, we achieve a 76\% accuracy in predicting spatial frame resolution (SFR), a performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for VoD traffic prediction.

% Network traffic is increasingly becoming encrypted. It is no longer possible to intercept protocol packets and derive valuable insights regarding the content. Internet users are gradually but consistently shifting their usage to video content, therefore, gaining insight into perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) of video is of a special interest. The majority of the efforts have been invested in extracting quality metrics of encrypted Video on Demand (VOD) services. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been reported on the use of Machine Learning (ML) for extracting quality metrics of video conferencing, also sometimes referred to as real-time video traffic. In this paper, we study the network behavior of Zoom video conferencing traffic, extract features from the encrypted network data packet streams and classify them by learning to infer Full Reference (FR) and No Reference (NR) video quality metrics. We created a dataset and trained Machine Learning (ML) models to classify the traffic quality metrics. We demonstrate an outstanding accuracy of 97\% in predicting the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE), and 87\% in predicting the fps. We also predicted the spatial frame resolution and obtained a 76\% accuracy level, which is consistent with the accuracy levels achieved in the state-of-the-art for VOD traffic.
