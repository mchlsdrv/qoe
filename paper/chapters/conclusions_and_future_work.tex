\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have explored the extraction of QoE metrics of encrypted Zoom video conferencing traffic. By using Decision Tree algorithms, which have emerged as a predominant classification method for VoD traffic, we have obtained similar accuracy results for classifying resolution on our relatively small dataset of 720 samples. We further used a Neural Network model to predict additional QoE metrics that were extracted from the Zoom application and calculated from the video streams themselves. We have demonstrated excellent accuracy in predicting the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE). We are presently working on enhanced automations that will allow us to capture larger datasets in order to drive a more robust and generic prediction model. In addition, we plan to expand the scope of this research to other video conferencing tools, notably Microsoft Teams and Google GoToMeeting. We further plan to create a large dataset of Video Conferencing clips and perform a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) experiment with human observers. We will then compare the results of the metrics to those of the MOS and perform classification for both.
